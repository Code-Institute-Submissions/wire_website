# Wire - Pink flag still flying

I plan on making a website that pays homage to Wire, founded in 1976 they have consistently been pushing the boundaries of punk, post punk, experimental and electronic music for over forty years and have stayed as relevant today as they were in the 70's. The website wil be a live portal to the bands current incarnation and will include information on the bands memebers past and present and information on their upcoming gigs.

## UX
I have created user stories for three potential users tha would be the demographic of the Wire listener. Considering the focus of the band over the last 40 years has been to aim for contemporary listeners the 
- primary persona will be a 17 - 24 year old who is into music and has discovered wire through spotify or through youtube. This user is interested in individual songs rather than complete albums. They are concert goers but would mainly be the streaming type listener. The bands experimental side is very much their cache when it comes to this user and their contemporary sound is the focus for this user.  
- the second persona is the classic Wire listener who has been listening to them since the 80's or 90's and is interested in the more vintage early punk or post-punk sound. This user older has more disposable income and is interested in hardcopy of the music on vinyl or cd. This user is the gig going type but with the band as headliner rather than a festival type scenario. 
- the third persona is festival goer who may have come accross Wire in  a live setting where they may not have been headlining. This user is the more transient user of the site that is looking for information on what festivals or locations they are playing. 

## Features
I plan on having a simple landing page that shows some of the artwork from the band over the years and links off to the media pages and to the information pages. I pand on putting a page re. each band members information and a timeline for the bands milestones.

This will allow users to find information about the bands history personnel and their upcoming gigs. Also I would like to link through to an e-commerce such as bandcamp so that patrons can purchase digital files or hardcopy of their music. Ultimatly I would like this to be integrated into the website but for the purposes of this site I will be happy to like off to it. 


Existing Features
play sounds from soundcloud on the page allows users to listen to tracks from the band

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

## Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
