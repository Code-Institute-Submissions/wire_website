# Wire - Pink flag still flying

I plan on making a website that pays homage to Wire, founded in 1976 they have consistently been pushing the boundaries of punk, post punk, experimental and electronic music for over forty years and have stayed as relevant today as they were in the 70's. The website wil be a live portal to the bands current incarnation and will include information on the bands memebers past and present and information on their upcoming gigs.

## Features
I plan on having a simple landing page that shows some of the artwork from the band over the years and links off to the media pages and to the information pages. I plan on putting a page re. each band members information and a timeline for the bands milestones in a history page.

This will allow users to find information about the bands history personnel and their upcoming gigs. Also I would like to link through to an e-commerce such as bandcamp so that patrons can purchase digital files or hardcopy of their music. Ultimatley I would like this to be integrated into the website but for the purposes of this site I will be happy to like off to it. 
for ease of finding information on the bands upcoming Gigs I would like to add a link to social media sites.


## Existing Features
play sounds from soundcloud on the page allows users to listen to tracks from the band.
i-frame of the bands social media

## Features Left to Implement
responsive media for the menus. I would like to have the top menu to be a hamburger for mobile . this is to clear up space on the page. 

## Contact form:

not sure of a contact form , though probably should put to show that i can

## Deployment
this will be created in cloud9. I will be creating a repo for the files on Git-hub as backup.
