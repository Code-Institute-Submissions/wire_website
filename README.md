# Wire - Pink flag still flying

I plan on making a website that pays homage to Wire, founded in 1976 they have consistently been pushing the boundaries of punk, post punk, experimental and electronic music for over forty years and have stayed as relevant today as they were in the 70's. The website wil be a live portal to the bands current incarnation and will include information on the bands memebers past and present and information on their upcoming gigs.

## UX
I have created user stories for three potential users tha would be the demographic of the Wire listener. Considering the focus of the band over the last 40 years has been to aim for contemporary listeners the 
- primary persona will be a 17 - 24 year old who is into music and has discovered wire through spotify or through youtube. This user is interested in individual songs rather than complete albums. They are concert goers but would mainly be the streaming type listener. The bands experimental side is very much their cache when it comes to this user and their contemporary sound is the focus for this user.  
- the second persona is the classic Wire listener who has been listening to them since the 80's or 90's and is interested in the more vintage early punk or post-punk sound. This user older has more disposable income and is interested in hardcopy of the music on vinyl or cd. This user is the gig going type but with the band as headliner rather than a festival type scenario. 
- the third persona is festival goer who may have come accross Wire in  a live setting where they may not have been headlining. This user is the more transient user of the site that is looking for information on what festivals or locations they are playing. 

## Features
I plan on having a simple landing page that shows some of the artwork from the band over the years and links off to the media pages and to the information pages. I plan on putting a page re. each band members information and a timeline for the bands milestones in a history page.

This will allow users to find information about the bands history personnel and their upcoming gigs. Also I would like to link through to an e-commerce such as bandcamp so that patrons can purchase digital files or hardcopy of their music. Ultimatley I would like this to be integrated into the website but for the purposes of this site I will be happy to like off to it. 
for ease of finding information on the bands upcoming Gigs I would like to add a link to social media sites.


## Existing Features
play sounds from soundcloud on the page allows users to listen to tracks from the band.
i-frame of the bands social media

## Features Left to Implement
responsive media for the menus. I would like to have the top menu to be a hamburger for mobile . this is to clear up space on the page. 

## Contact form:
