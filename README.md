![what is important](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nihilsmaw/wire_website/master/md_images/survey_results.png)

The results gave me an indication of what categories were important for users. The participants of the survey reference the following categories in order:

	1. Audio
	2. Band history
	3. Upcoming gigs
	4. Video
	5. Band social media / Band Gallery, Band Bio
	6. Band fan forum

|How do you discover old bands?| Do you follow up and visit bands websites?|What information is most important to you?|What band websites do you like?|

I took these answers into consideration when considering the categories for my website design.

The Empathy Map help to gain an insight into how personas ‘Think and feel’, ‘See’, ‘Say and Do’ and ‘Hear’. It gives a perspective into what the ‘Pains’ and ’Gains’ are. Below is a digital empathy map that I did in realtimeboard so that I could begin to empathise with users and fans of Wire.

![Empathy Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nihilsmaw/wire_website/master/md_images/empathy_map.png)

##### Problem Statment
After empathising with adhoc personas I was able to gain an insight into current issues on the website. I created problem statements to help inform the direction my design was .
<br>
“I am (Alex) trying to (find a gig) but (the Wire website is cluttered) because (of to much information) which makes me feel (frustrated).”
<br>
“I am (Shelly) trying to (listen to Wires music) but (the Wire website navigation is hard to follow) because (I can’t see the tabs) which makes me feel (confused).”
<br>
“I am (Justin) trying to (look Wire videos) but (I can’t see the site on my phone) because (the site isn’t responsive) which makes me feel (annoyed).”
<br>

##### Hypothesis
I believe that a simple responsive interface that uses colours and imagery from the bands history will resonate with fans. A clean font and site will be legible, accessible and enhance engagement on the site.

##### Learning from competitor research
The competitor research has given me an insight into what other bands value on their website. From my explorations I have discovered that numerous fringe bands that may have been cutting edge have not kept their online presence up-to-date. 

##### Some priority categories that have emerged:
A common theme is a  subscribe to newsletter but band websites didn’t have a contact form. Band photography and band bio are important. Common themes also included having audio, video and past/current gigs.

##### My design:
For the purpose of this website it would be good to keep the website clean and functional but bring the style of the music into the website. This will enhance the experience of users as the music style will make the site enjoyable.

# User Flow

# 4. Prototype
Once I decided the user flow that was the most appropriate for the audience. I wireframed the pages for the site. From my original sketches I designed a clean, logical and precise layout with the detail that is required for moving to the next step.

### Moodboard
Once I decided on the direction I decided the colours and typography that would be appropriate for the users of the site. I used inVision to gain an insight from the moodboard tools for colour. I based the typography on a san serif, clean legible font that reflected the album cover. The name of the font is ‘Worksans’.
