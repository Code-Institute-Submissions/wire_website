## Introduction
I plan on making a website that pays homage to Wire, founded in 1976 they have consistently been pushing the boundaries of punk, post punk, experimental and electronic music for over forty years and have stayed as relevant today as they were in the 70's. The website wil be a live portal to the bands current incarnation and will include information on the bands memebers past and present and information on their upcoming gigs.

## UX

I have created user stories for three potential users tha would be the demographic of the Wire listener. Considering the focus of the band over the last 40 years has been to aim for contemporary listeners the 

- primary persona will be a 17 - 24 year old who is into music and has discovered wire through spotify or through youtube. This user is interested in individual songs rather than complete albums. They are concert goers but would mainly be the streaming type listener. The bands experimental side is very much their cache when it comes to this user and their contemporary sound is the focus for this user.  

- the second persona is the classic Wire listener who has been listening to them since the 80's or 90's and is interested in the more vintage early punk or post-punk sound. This user older has more disposable income and is interested in hardcopy of the music on vinyl or cd. This user is the gig going type but with the band as headliner rather than a festival type scenario. 

- the third persona is festival goer who may have come accross Wire in  a live setting where they may not have been headlining. This user is the more transient user of the site that is looking for information on what festivals or locations they are playing. 

I plan on having a simple landing page that shows some of the artwork from the band over the years and links off to the media pages and to the information pages. I plan on putting a page re. each band members information and a timeline for the bands milestones in a history page.


## 1. Empathise
#### Band Research
###### Current Site

![Current Site](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nihilsmaw/wire_website/master/md_images/pink_flag.png)<br>
Website is not responsive. The navigation is and to read and is not accessible for users.


### Survey Research
#### Link to Survey > [How do you discover old Bands?](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YDPSMKNokAyRYbS9xY9tMp7E4q2i35HpwZygb7rrcH0/edit#responses)

###### Design survey to get appropriate information.


![Survey](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nihilsmaw/wire_website/master/md_images/survey.png)

###### Reddit: Best location for high rate of traffic for answers. 



![Survey Location](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nihilsmaw/wire_website/master/md_images/reddit.png)


###### Let the answers roll in.
![what is important](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nihilsmaw/wire_website/master/md_images/survey_results.png)

The results gave me an indication of what categories were important for users. The participants of the survey reference the following categories in order:

	1. Audio
	2. Band history
	3. Upcoming gigs
	4. Video
	5. Band social media / Band Gallery, Band Bio
	6. Band fan forum
#### Results Table
|How do you discover old bands?| Do you follow up and visit bands websites?|What information is most important to you?|What band websites do you like?|
|:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|
|Spotify|yes|Audio||

I took these answers into consideration when considering the categories for my website design.
<br><br><br>

#### Empathise with Fans
###### Engage with fan-forum
![Fan forum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nihilsmaw/wire_website/master/md_images/fan_discussion_forum.png)

## 2. Define
#### Empathy Mapping
![Empathy](https://github.com/nihilsmaw/wire_website/blob/master/md_images/empathy_map.jpg?raw=true)
[Link: Interaction Design Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/stage-2-in-the-design-thinking-process-define-the-problem-and-interpret-the-results)

The Empathy Map help to gain an insight into how personas ‘Think and feel’, ‘See’, ‘Say and Do’ and ‘Hear’. It gives a perspective into what the ‘Pains’ and ’Gains’ are. Below is a digital empathy map that I did in realtimeboard so that I could begin to empathise with users and fans of Wire.

![Empathy Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nihilsmaw/wire_website/master/md_images/empathy_map.png)

##### Problem Statment
After empathising with adhoc personas I was able to gain an insight into current issues on the website. I created problem statements to help inform the direction my design was .

“I am (Alex) trying to (find a gig) but (the Wire website is cluttered) because (of to much information) which makes me feel (frustrated).”

“I am (Shelly) trying to (listen to Wires music) but (the Wire website navigation is hard to follow) because (I can’t see the tabs) which makes me feel (confused).”

“I am (Justin) trying to (look Wire videos) but (I can’t see the site on my phone) because (the site isn’t responsive) which makes me feel (annoyed).”
<br>

##### Hypothesis
I believe that a simple responsive interface that uses colours and imagery from the bands history will resonate with fans. A clean font and site will be legible, accessible and enhance engagement on the site.

##### Learning from competitor research
The competitor research has given me an insight into what other bands value on their website. From my explorations I have discovered that numerous fringe bands that may have been cutting edge have not kept their online presence up-to-date. 

##### Some priority categories that have emerged:
A common theme is a  subscribe to newsletter but band websites didn’t have a contact form. Band photography and band bio are important. Common themes also included having audio, video and past/current gigs.

### Design considerations
For the purpose of this website it would be good to keep the website clean and functional but bring the style of the music into the website. This will enhance the experience of users as the music style will make the site enjoyable.

### Brainstorm
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nihilsmaw/wire_website/master/md_images/brainstorm.jpg)

##### Sketches
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nihilsmaw/wire_website/master/md_images/Sketch1_LP.jpg)
<br>

<br>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nihilsmaw/wire_website/master/md_images/sketch3_NF.jpg)
Sketching a number of ideas helped me consider a different possibilities. This was low effort and a quick way to consider various page layouts. After considering a number of possibilities I decided on a version that I think would hold up to my hypothesis. I then moved on to consider the user flow of the website in more detail.
### User Flow
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nihilsmaw/wire_website/master/md_images/user_flow.jpg)
By moving away from the sketches and considering how the user flowed through the website insured that my information architecture worked and was logical. This helped me visualise the main gateways through the site.

# 4. Prototype
### Wireframes 
Once I decided the user flow that was the most appropriate for the audience. I wireframed the pages for the site. From my original sketches I designed a clean, logical and precise layout with the detail that is required for moving to the next step.

<br>

### Moodboard
Once I decided on the direction I decided the colours and typography that would be appropriate for the users of the site. I used inVision to gain an insight from the moodboard tools for colour. I based the typography on a san serif, clean legible font that reflected the album cover. The name of the font is ‘Worksans’.

# 4. Feedback
### User Tests
#### Script (approx 10min)

Hi [  user name  ], My name is Frank and I’m doing some research to help design a band website.  Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. 

Before we begin, I’d like to cover a few points: 
This discussion will take approx [10] minutes

We will ask you to review a website and do a few tasks. We are not testing you. There are no right or wrong answers. Your feedback will help us to improve the website, so please be honest about your thoughts and experiences. **Please speak out loud as you are using the site.**

If you have any questions please ask. I’ll do my best to answer them. 
Do you have any questions before we begin?

* What do you think this website is about?
* Where would you go to find out about current events.
* Where would you find videos?
* Find where you would listen to audio on the site
* Go to the biography area of the site. Tell me who you think this page is about?
* Do you think the website gives a good representation to the type of band genre?
* Overall, what do you like/dislike about the website? Be as frank as you like, I won’t be offended.

#### See user test on youtube (click image)

### Iterations
Overall the user test was very positive. The participant easily navigated the site and was able to use it. She was able to complete all the tasks that were asked of her. She mentioned that it would be nice to see a list of songs for audio. This is something that would benefit the audience and I will consider iterating the website based on this feedback.
