                Housed in a sturdy box with a beautiful cover concept by Bruce Gilbert, NINE SEVENS is a unique set of nine 7-inch records that were recorded between 1977 and 1980. This strictly limited edition is a Record Store Day exclusive. The box-set includes the
                six ground-breaking Wire singles that were originally released on the Harvest label, one released on Rough Trade, and one single recorded in 1980 that was never released on 7- inch. The set also includes the rare EP given away with the
                first pressings of 154. Everything is freshly remastered from the original archive analogue sources, and comes packaged in the original picture sleeve designs. The singles will be individually released digitally after Record Store Day
                but will not be compiled on a singles or greatest hits album Due to the fact that this is a Record Store Day exclusive we can only offer this for Mail Order if we have stocks left at the end of the Record Store Day period. So if you want
                to be sure to get your copy there's a guide to participating shops near you on the Record Store Day website. Here's the contents</br>
